# Pedestrian-Crowd-Detection-Final-Project
Real-time pedestrian and crowd detection system developed as a Pattern Recognition final project. The project detects pedestrians, tracks individuals using Kalman filtering and Hungarian matching, and estimates crowd density from video streams. Adapted and extended from the Crowd-Analyzer repository.
